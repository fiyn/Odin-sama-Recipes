        <h1>Coconut Coconut Milk Cake</h1>

        <p><img src="../images/coconutcake.jpg" alt="Coconut Milk Cake Picture"></p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a super moist and tasty coconut cake. Growing up in Brazil, this was a favorite amongst our circle of friends. It is especially good with a cup of coffee on the side. I've converted a few of my anti-coconut family and friends into lovers of this cake.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li> 
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Step 1</b><br> 
                <p>
                    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Step 2</b><br> 
                <p>
                    Beat sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a bowl using 
                    an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add shredded coconut.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Step 3</b><br> 
                <p>
                    Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir creamed butter mixture, 
                    alternating with coconut milk, 
                    into flour mixture until batter is just mixed.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Step 4</b><br> 
                <p>
                    Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until until soft peaks form. 
                    Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. 
                    Fold egg whites into batter. 
                    Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Step 5</b><br> 
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake 
                    comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
